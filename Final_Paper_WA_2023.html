              <b>Summary</b><br />
              Senate Bill 310 (SB 310) is a new bill that would expand cultural
              burning in California, a practice by some tribes that applies
              sophisticated burning methods to manage resources, promote
              adaptive landscapes to changing climactic conditions, and connect
              humans to the land. SB 310 also convenes a working group,
              including members from California Native American Tribes, to build
              a research-based framework to facilitate cultural burns in the
              future. In this report, we analyze SB 310 and highlight the
              importance of Indigenous people and their knowledge into research,
              policy, and decision-making. <br /><br />

              Indigenous Fire Stewardship Fires are an integral part of
              watersheds in the Sierra Nevada that shape ecosystem structure and
              the availability of water and resources (Rhoades et al., 2019).
              However, a history of fire suppression and the genocide, forced
              assimilation, and criminalization of Indigenous people have
              removed Indigenous people and their fire management practices from
              the landscape (Adlam et al., 2022). These fire-suppressed areas
              are degrading from cascading disasters - intense drought,
              higher-severity wildfires, and destructive flooding events. For
              example, the Rim Fire destroyed 256,428 acres of forest
              surrounding the Tuolumne River in 2013 (U.S. Forest Service,
              n.d.), resulting in large-scale habitat destruction that continues
              to impact the region to present day (Roodsarabi et al., 2023).
              Indigenous people have intensely managed California lands with
              fire to support ecological, cultural, economic, and societal needs
              as part of Indigenous Fire Stewardship (Adlam et al., 2022; Lake,
              2021). Burning practices are applied with frequency, seasonality,
              and specificity to the ecology of the land and in response to
              changing environmental and climatic conditions (Lake, 2021).
              Cultural burning as a spiritual and ecological tool results in
              fires that are smaller, more controlled, frequent, and less
              intense than natural (lightning) fires (Lake, 2021; Adlam et al.,
              2022). These practices share common methodologies with Western
              scientific processes and incorporate geology, topography, soils,
              vegetation, fuels, weather, fire behavior, and fire effects, among
              many other social and environmental dynamics (Lake, 2021). Over
              time, a mosaic of fire regimes, known as pyrodiversity, develops
              and facilitates healthier forest habitats and greater biodiversity
              (Martin and Sapsis, 1992). Government policies must incorporate
              Indigenous people into the decision-making process and establish
              respectful collaborations towards tribal sovereignty, tribal
              decisions, and equitable outcomes. These efforts are
              interconnected with our collective need to restore degraded
              landscapes, promote adaptable ecosystems, and ensure the
              well-being of people and the environment. Here we review Senate
              Bill 310, a new bill introduced in the 2023 legislative season
              that revitalizes Indigenous Fire Stewardship to manage
              historically fire-suppressed landscapes. Senate Bill 310: Cultural
              Burning Bill Overview Senate Bill 310 acknowledges tribal
              sovereignty regarding cultural burning in California and creates a
              process for federally recognized California Native American Tribes
              and the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) to enter into
              agreements to waive various state regulatory requirements for
              cultural burns until January 1, 2029. The bill also requires that
              the Secretary of CNRA convene a cultural burn working group that
              includes certain State environmental agencies, California Native
              American Tribes, local air pollution control districts, and local
              governments. This group's goal is to determine a framework in
              support of cultural burning and report back to the legislature by
              January 1, 2025. Support and Opposition Public supporters of SB
              310 include the Karuk Tribe and various environmental
              organizations; they argue this bill would allow the pace and scale
              of prescribed burn activities to increase. The California Air
              Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA) and South Coast
              Air Quality Management District have publicly opposed the bill;
              they argue that this bill could affect current safeguards that
              protect downwind communities from prescribed burn emissions.
              Future of the Bill SB 310 was marked as a two-year bill, meaning
              it can be heard and voted on again during the 23-24 legislative
              session. To be signed into law, the bill will need to be heard by
              the Assembly Appropriations committee, taken to a vote on the
              Assembly and Senate Floor, and then signed by the Governor before
              October 15, 2024. Conclusion and implications Overall, SB 310
              would allow for the expansion of cultural burning in California,
              while simultaneously conducting research and promoting robust
              discussion on how to best continue to expand cultural burning. We
              are disheartened to see that this bill would only apply to
              federally recognized tribes, because it excludes the dozens of
              non-federally recognized tribes in the state, but we believe the
              Cultural Burn Working Group's report will be of particular
              importance to the overall implementation of this bill and future
              legislation on this topic. We encourage engagement and support of
              this bill and other policies that establish collaborative
              partnerships to further Tribal sovereignty and Tribal-lead
              scientific research, policy, and decision-making. Contacts for SB
