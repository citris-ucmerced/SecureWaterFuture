        <p>The Secure Water Future educational catalogue coalesces around the basic premise that “You can’t learn about water without getting wet.” We invite K-12, college, and graduate students to dive into our programming. Through experiential learning exercises, we illustrate the impacts of uncertainty due to climate change and the potential for technological and management solutions to improve our collective future water security.</p>

			<p>Super Soaker Water Academy is a week-long program that teaches students all about water and how it is stored and used in California. By the end of the week, students have participated in water activities to teach them the relationship between water, agriculture, climate change, and how we can use technology to help our water systems. The program includes a kayaking field trip on Lake Yosemite, drone programming and navigation, and the creation of StoryMaps.</p>

			<p>Secure Water Future engages students through project-based learning programs, deepening domain-specific expertise and enhancing critical thinking. Our initiatives, such as the Water Hack Challenge and the Aqua Arcade Game Jam, tackle real-world issues and promote a comprehensive understanding of water resources in California's Central Valley. <br /><br /> SWF is inclusive, welcoming students from all academic years and disciplines. We ensure that our programs are not only educational but also enjoyable, helping students grasp the complexities of water management, scientific communication, and the nexus between water and data. Moreover, our college programs are free to enter and include perks like swag, meals, and training, with opportunities to win exciting prizes!</p>

			<p>Our ability to adapt to a changing climate with uncertain water resources necessitates cultivating the next generation of climate and water leaders through immersion in scientific evidence. Secure Water Future provides a selective cohort of graduate students with an experiential summer training program designed to introduce western water management complexity, climate change challenges, and a network of water leaders to build their skills in climate adaptation science, science communication, and transdisciplinary research. This Climate Adaptation Science Academy Experiential Learning Expedition (CASA ELE) brings unique field learning experiences, hands-on training in climate-affected organizations, and the development of educational, outreach, and translational products. CASA ELE graduate student participants will become proficient in communicating hydroclimate information and societal response across the western United States.</p>
