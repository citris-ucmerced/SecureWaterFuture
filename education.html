        <p>The Secure Water Future educational catalogue coalesces around the basic premise that “You can’t learn about water without getting wet.” We invite K-12, college, and graduate students to dive into our programming. Through experiential learning exercises, we illustrate the impacts of uncertainty due to climate change and the potential for technological and management solutions to improve our collective future water security.</p>

			<p>Super Soaker Water Academy is a week-long program that teaches students all about water and how it is stored and used in California. By the end of the week, students have participated in water activities to teach them the relationship between water, agriculture, climate change, and how we can use technology to help our water systems. The program includes a kayaking field trip to Lake Yosemite, drone programming and navigation, and the creation of StoryMaps.</p>

			<p>Secure Water Future Water Hack Challenge was a weekend-long innovative space for students to explore data-driven solutions to water issues. Over the course of the weekend, participants were invited to join with a team of known or new friends for the opportunity to learn new skills. We encouraged participation from various backgrounds and welcomed students from all years and disciplines. By the end of the weekend, participants had a better understanding of water resources in the Central Valley of California, how to communicate scientific data, and how water and data intersect. There were no registration costs, swag and food were provided, participants received training, and teams had the opportunity to win as much as $2,500!</p>

			<p>Our ability to adapt to a changing climate with uncertain water resources necessitates cultivating the next generation of climate and water leaders through immersion in scientific evidence. Secure Water Future provides a selective cohort of graduate students with an experiential summer training program designed to introduce western water management complexity, climate change challenges, and a network of water leaders to build their skills in climate adaptation science, science communication, and transdisciplinary research. This Climate Adaptation Science Academy Experiential Learning Expedition (CASA ELE) brings unique field learning experiences, hands-on training in climate-affected organizations, and the development of educational, outreach, and translational products. CASA ELE graduate student participants will become proficient in communicating hydroclimate information and societal response across the western United States.</p>
