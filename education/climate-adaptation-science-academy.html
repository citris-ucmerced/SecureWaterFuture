                                    Our collective ability to adapt to a changing climate with uncertain water resources
                                    necessitates that we cultivate the next generation of climate and water leaders
                                    through immersion in scientific evidence. Secure Water Future, led by UC Merced,
                                    provides selected graduate students with an experiential summer training program
                                    developed to mentor students about how to contribute to transdisciplinary climate
                                    research and outreach initiatives. These students benefit from training in
                                    communication, computational science, and climate change adaptation planning.
                                    Through unique field learning experiences; hands-on training in climate-affected
                                    organizations; and the development of educational, outreach, and translational
                                    products, CASA graduate students affect short-term and long-term climate information
                                    and response across the Western United States.
                                </p>
                                <p>This summer, CASA participants will receive training from academic experts and water
                                    leadership organizations like Kern Groundwater Banking Authority, Rosedale Rio Bravo
                                    Irrigation District and groundwater sustainability agencies, USDA Climate Hubs,
                                    Department of Water Resources, and leaders of AB 1755 California Open Water Data
                                    programs. These partnerships will result in useful tools for the organization while
                                    strengthening the overall quality and utility of the larger research enterprise.
                                    What students learn during their summer internships will be shared through written
                                    and oral presentations to the full Secure Water Future team so that all may gain
                                    experience through their relationships.</p>

                                <p>Over several days in August, the selected students will travel by van and raft with
                                    their faculty and organizational mentors to experience first-hand the fabled
                                    semi-arid Western US and its water, agricultural, and natural resources
                                    infrastructure and processes for decision-making. This experiential trip includes
                                    meeting the people who affect and are affected by these management choices. CASA is
                                    based on successful educational models, including the UC Water Academy, and spans
                                    various components of the regional water management cycle:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Surface water: Headwaters and monitoring stations, reservoirs</li>

                                        almonds to figs</li>
                                    <li>Dairies and the full life cycle of food, energy, water nexus: biogas and solar
                                    </li>
