							<!--<b>Our long-term goal is to evaluate and enable water trading for climate resilience in
								agricultural and ecological systems in the Southwestern US.</b> -->

							<p>
								To achieve climate change adaptation in western agriculture, we need better information
								and institutions about the most important input: WATER.
							</p>
							<p>
								This transdisciplinary team
								addresses key questions in water management, from the field to regional scales, and how
								to support thriving agriculture, healthy ecosystems and community resilience. This
								program delivers overdue tools and techniques for a waterstressed region, enabling
								thriving agriculture, healthy ecosystems, and community resilience in an uncertain
								climate future.
							</p>
							<p> <b>Project Goal: </b>By coupling hydroeconomic and life-cycle evaluation with
								localized water accounting and regional climate projections, the project goal is to
								evaluate and enable water trading for climate resilience in agricultural and ecological
								systems in the Southwestern US.</p>

							<p>
							<div style="text-align: center;">
								<img style="width:60%;" src="images/images/overview.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							Securing a climate resilient water future rests on decisions informed by climate data
							coupled with accurate measurements, novel management practices, and well-designed
							markets. Focused transdisciplinary activities integrate research, extension, and
							education across three testbeds to actively engage stakeholders in achieving
							sustainability in water scarce regions.
							</p>

						<section class="box post">
							<h2 class="major2"><span>Extension</span></h2>
							<p>With Extension as the main focus, we engage USDA Southwest Climate Hub expertise and the
								extension-grower networks of each state’s university outreach system to ADOPT new
								technologies and practices, ADAPT to local situations, and AMPLIFY what works. </p>
							<p><b>Our stakeholders: </b> The transdisciplinary project team will work with growers,
								irrigation districts, and ecosystem managers to adopt and adapt climate resilience
								strategies, and train a next generation of transdisciplinary practitioners versed in
								climate adaptation science and complex systems problem solving.</p>
							<p>With decades of experience in irrigation, climate science and each commodity, the
								Extension team will facilitate whole-project integration through a Day-One Needs
								Assessment, keep connection with innovation leaders, and share all program findings
								through both informal education and formal communications.</p>

							<div style="text-align: center;">
								<img style="width:70%;" src="images/images/flow.png" alt="" />
							</div>
							The SWIM team is focused on four research thrusts:

							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Climate Resilience:</b> Developing climate services for data-driven decisions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Markets:</b> Research and practice on water markets through economics and
									institutions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Management:</b> Evaluate novel management strategies to secure water.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Measurement :</b> Improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in water budgets.
								</li>
							</ul>
