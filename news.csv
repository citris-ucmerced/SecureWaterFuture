Based on this experience, they offer recommendations to better protect the environment if California is faced with dry conditions in 2022 or beyond."
"","Implications of the Drought for California Agriculture","https://nature.berkeley.edu/news/2021/11/implications-drought-california-agriculture","Read More","November 4, 2021| By Ria DeBiase","The 2020–21 drought has been unusually severe. Low precipitation, coupled with high evaporative demand has affected irrigated agriculture and livestock pastures. Yet California agriculture is adept at adapting. The authors of a new special issue of <a href=https://s.giannini.ucop.edu/uploads/pub/2021/10/29/v25n1_PtGmO5o.pdf target=_blank><em>ARE Update</em></a> find that, despite record-setting drought conditions and hundreds of thousands of acres left unplanted, California farms and ranches, as a whole, may generate normal revenue in 2021. <p><a href=https://are.berkeley.edu/user/13761 target=_blank>Ellen Bruno</a>, an assistant Cooperative Extension specialist in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, is a co-editor of the special issue and the author of the conclusion section of the publication.</p>"
