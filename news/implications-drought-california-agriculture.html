                                <p>The 2020–21 drought has been unusually severe. Low precipitation, coupled with high
                                    evaporative demand has affected irrigated agriculture and livestock pastures. Yet
                                    California agriculture is adept at adapting. The authors of a new special issue of
                                    <a href=https://s.giannini.ucop.edu/uploads/pub/2021/10/29/v25n1_PtGmO5o.pdf
                                        target=_blank><em>ARE Update</em></a> find that, despite record-setting
                                    drought conditions and hundreds of thousands of acres left unplanted, California
                                    farms and ranches, as a whole, may generate normal revenue in 2021.</p>

                                <p><a href=https://are.berkeley.edu/user/13761 target=_blank>Ellen Bruno</a>, an
                                    assistant Cooperative Extension specialist in the Department of Agricultural and
                                    Resource Economics, is a co-editor of the special issue and the author of the
                                    conclusion section of the publication.</p>

                                <p>The 2020 water year (which runs from October 2019–September 2020) was dry and hot in
                                    California, with the warmest April through September since 1895. It was followed by
                                    the third driest year since 1895—receiving about half of the average 20th century
                                    rainfall. Consecutive years with record-setting warm, dry conditions have led to
                                    higher evaporative demand. Some regions, particularly the Sacramento basin, have
                                    been hit especially hard by this ongoing drought.</p>

                                <p>California farms have adapted to the resulting water shortages by transferring scarce
                                    irrigation water to crops that have a higher expected net revenue per drop, such as
                                    fresh produce and nut crops, while leaving some fields unplanted. Due to the
                                    decreased pasture forage available, livestock producers have had to cull mature cows
                                    and ship more feeder cattle out of state. </p>

                                <p>The drought’s impact on farm revenues and prices in California has varied across
                                    crops and regions. Coastal agriculture (e.g., vegetable, berry, and winegrape
                                    production), which accounts for 25% of farm output, is less susceptible to
                                    irrigation cutbacks. According to the publication, consumers will notice few major
                                    price increases for California produce because farmers shifted water to these
                                    high-revenue crops in which California specializes.</p>

                                <p>The special issue on drought concludes with an explanation of policy changes that
                                    have improved the California water system in the past and envisions how we might
                                    further change policy to mitigate impacts of future droughts. Legislations such as
                                    the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) will facilitate adapting to new
                                    climate realities by incentivizing water trading and banking, which allow water
                                    users to better allocate water across space and time. </p>

                                <p>Most groundwater agencies are still assessing the best way to bring their overdrafted
                                    groundwater basins into compliance with SGMA, with almost 80% planning to recharge
                                    groundwater through increasing supply (e.g., recharge or surface water trading)
                                    rather than reducing water demand (e.g., pumping restrictions). </p>

                                <p>“No one single solution exists for California’s water challenges, but there’s a lot
                                    of potential to make improvements to the current system,” said Bruno. “Improving the
                                    allocation of water through various policy changes could help water users adapt to
                                    water scarcity.”</p>
