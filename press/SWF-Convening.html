                                After working in a virtual environment for nearly two years on the US Department of
                                Agriculture-funded project, Secure Water Future, researchers from NM WRRI and NMSU
                                joined their counterparts from UC Merced, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UC Agriculture and
                                Natural Resources, Utah State, Environmental Defense Fund, and the Public Policy
                                Institute of California for a two-day in-person project team meeting. The meeting took
                                place on the campus of UC Berkeley from January 5 through January 7. The main purpose of
                                the meeting was to build stronger collaborations and coordination between researchers at
                                the different research sites in three states working across four main research thrusts
                                at three spatial scales (region, district, and farm). The research thrusts include
                                climate integration, markets, management, and measurement with education and outreach as
                                overarching activities to achieve the goal of understanding, enabling, and envisioning
                                water management strategies for agricultural and ecological systems in the Southwest.
                                The research is important for New Mexico, as water managers and researchers work
                                together to find innovative solutions to sustain agriculture in times of continued water
                                scarcity. <br><br>

                                Several main outcomes resulted from the meeting. The primary outcome was a greater
                                connection between team members, which is necessary to build trust, align individual
                                goals with project goals, and integrate the broad depth of knowledge each team member
                                brings to the project. Progress was made in envisioning the utility of Water 3D, the
                                web-based tool being developed for the project. Another outcome was an outline of
                                project deliverables for year 2 of the project, which will include numerous
                                publications, presentations, and the development of an educational game to teach about
                                the impacts of water management decisions.<br><br>

                                Although only a subset of the team was able to attend, the entire project team includes
                                over 70 researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and support staff.<br><br>

                                The team will convene again July 17-19 in Denver for the American Water Resources
                                Association meeting to present the most recent results of the research.
