                                Secure Water Future Water Hack Challenge is a weekend-long innovative space for students to explore data-driven solutions to water issues. Over the course of the weekend, we invite you to join with a team of known or new friends for the opportunity to learn new skills.
                                <br>

                                We encourage participation from various backgrounds and welcome students from all years and disciplines. By the end of the weekend, you will have a better understanding of water resources in our region, how to communicate scientific data, and how water and data intersect.
                                <br>
